Why biostatisticians learn to program
===

- **Job:** Industry, academic, collaboration...
- **Independence:** otherwise, you rely on someone else giving you exactly the right tool
- **Honesty:** otherwise, you end up distorting your problem to match the tools you have
- **Clarity:** often, turning your ideas into something a machine can do refines your thinking
- **Fun:** these were the best of times (the worst of times)

Grade policy
===


Exams
===
- Mid-term exam (In class or take home?)
- Final exam (In class or take home?)


Final project
===
- Wrap up a R package (with one of these options)
    * S3/S4 class
    * calling c++
    * make nice vignette
- Complete documentation of all your functions.
- Apply R package to real data or synthetic data.
- Report using R markdown, include how you used your own package.


R, R Studio, R Markdown
===

- R is a programming language for statistical computing
- R Studio is an integrated development environment for R programming  
- R Markdown is a markup language for combining R code with text

All 3 are free, and all 3 will be used extensively in this course

(survey, demo)


Things you should have done, by the end of this week
===

- Install R Studio on your laptop
- Get comfortable with R Studio, knitting Rmd documents into HTML files
- Get comfortable with navigating R help files
- Get comfortable with installing R packages


Questions
===
- HiPerGator for student, how should students use it?
- Targeted audience
- computing vs algorithm? Emphasize
- In class lab/ all lectures?
- What will be on the qualifying exam?
- auto grading?
- graphics: ggplot2 or lattice
- Simulating random variables and simulation studies
    - size and power of a test
    - asymptotics
- lasso, SVM, LDA, CART, random forests, how deep should I cover
- Mid terms and Final example, take home or in class exam


Why we should learn R
===

- It's <span style="color:red">free</span>, open source, and available on every major platform. 
- A massive set of packges for statistical modeling, machine learning, visualization and importing and manipulating data. 
- Cutting edge tools.
- A fantastic community.
- Powerful tools for communicating your results. (html, pdf, interactive website).
- An IDE (RStudio).
- Connect to high-performance programming languages (C, C++, Java)
- When you published a statistical methodology paper, often you will be asked to publish a R package as well.


Some drawbacks of R
===
- R is not a particularly fast programming language, and poorly written R code can be terribly slow. R is also a profligate user of memory.
- R language focuses on results instead of processes. Too many R functions use tricks to reduce the amount of typing at the cost of making code hard to understand.
- R is slow in loop (e.g. for, while) so try to avoid loop in R if you run a large program and care about speed.


Installing R
===
- All R materials are download from the ``Comprehensive R Archive
Network" (CRAN), which is a collection of sites from around the world
carrying identical and current R code and documentation.
- R can be installed on Windows, Mac or Linux operating systems.
- In this course, the instructors will run R on Mac.
- To install R, visit the R website, [http://www.r-project.org](http://www.r-project.org) and follow the installation directions (see the FAQ section for more details).



R Console
===

- When you first open R, you will see the R \textbf{console} window. The console is
the fundamental way for interacting with R.
- In the console is a prompt, <span style="color:red">></span> this is where an **expression**, phrase of code that can be executed, is inputed into R (if entering lengthy expressions that require more than one line the prompt changes from > to +.
- An expression is typed into the console at the prompt, press Enter, and
the expression is evaluated.
- Depending on the expression, the system may respond by outputting results
to the console, creating a graph in a new window or performing some other
task. Then another expression can be inputed and evaluated.
- An R **session** is this interaction between you and the system.
- Often included with outputted results in the console are numbers in [  ].
These numbers are used to reference locations in the output.

RStudio
===

- RStudio is a free and open source integrated development environment (IDE) designed specifically for R.
   [http://www.rstudio.com](http://www.rstudio.com)
- Runs on, Windows, Mac or Linux operating systems.
- Useful productivity toolsï¼š
    - Syntax highlighting, smart indention, parentheses matching
    - Easily execute code from the source editor
    - Integrates all of the tools (source editor, console, plots, documentation, and more) when working with R into a single environment
    - Extensive tools for developing R packages
    - Interactive debugging for diagnosing and fixing errors

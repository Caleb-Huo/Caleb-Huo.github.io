Why do we need vectorized calculation
===
- Elegant and efficient
- R is slow in loops but fast for vectorized calculation.
```{r}
a <- 1:1000000
### version A, loop
start <- Sys.time()
meanA <- 0
for(i in seq_along(a)){
  meanA <- meanA + a[i]/length(a)
}
end <- Sys.time() 
end - start
meanA

### version B, vectorized calculation
start <- Sys.time()
mean(a)
end <- Sys.time() 
end - start

```
